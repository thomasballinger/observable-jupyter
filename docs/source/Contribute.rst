How to contribute
=================

| The Observable-Jupyter Visualization library has room to grow.
| With your help we can expand the current scope of the library to include
| a wide range of visualizations that will make Observable-Jupyter a one
| stop shop for simple and interactive data visualizations for python.

Creating an Observable Visualization
====================================

| The first thing that you will need to do to contribute a visualization to the 
| library is have a fully functioning visualization in observable.

| For the visualization to be fully functioning it must be operational from 
| a .ipynb environment using the Observable-Jupyter embed() function. A user must 
| also be able to pass in their own data. 

Creating a ipynb File
=====================

| Once you have a fully functioning visualization in Observable.
| You should make a .ipynb file that contains the steps needed to run the 
| visualization with the embed() function. 

| The .ipynb notebook should be structured similarly to how the current visualizations are structured.

Creating a Thumbnail and Adding to the Documentation
====================================================

| If you have a .ipynb file that is properly formated with a working visualization you will need to 
| go to github, clone the repo and follow the steps on the README.md file in the docs directory.
